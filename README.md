# Programming Language 0

__WARNING__: This language is work in progress and will be for a long time.

The first goal of this project is to create language that is [self-hosted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_%28compilers%29), with not to much noise around this task. For this reason language will be as simple as is reasonable for me.

## Goals and plans

- [x] Compiled
- [ ] [Structured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming)
- [ ] Turing Complete
- [ ] Self-hosted

## Content

- __pl0.cc__: C++ implementation of the language, used for creating language before self-hosted compiler
- __test.cc__: Simple test runner

## Trivia

- Current name refers to fact, that this will be my first self hosted programming language
- Test expected format is inspired by [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth)
